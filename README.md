## FAQ

### What are the goals and non-goals of this exercise?

 * GitHub Project page
 * Branches
 * Correct C++ programming

Non-goals:

 * In-depth C++ programming

### Why is there only one C++ file?

Because this is easiest for beginners to get compiled and running.

There will be more merge conflicts though ...

### Why don't we use [a testing framework]?

Because this projects requires as little as possible, 
to allow all beginners to get going easily.

## Summary of Snow White

This story is **MOSTLY** about dwarves...

Once upon a time ...
there was an average looking young men named White. He didn't know who his parents were, 
so his surname was Snow. He got bullied a lot for that growing up, which only made him stronger.





The witch gave Alan Turing an apple. But he wished for a Linux. Then he died :(

There lived a beautiful girl with her dad and jealous step-mother


The dwarves were working and singing in the mine.

the witch gave a red apple to Snow White. Actually there was a full basket of fruit.

So then, the witch gave a red apple to Snow White. Actually there was a full basket of fruit.
No, it was a comb.



Snow White fell asleep for a thousand years



This story involves some dwarves.
Grumpy was in a particularly foul mood due to problems with command prompt

Snow White lived with the dwarves. Being an expert programmer herself, she could help turn Grumpy's frown upside down.

and they lived happily ever after.

One day, there is a prince coming. Grumpy and Prince fought for Snow white's hand. Grumpy won the duel.

and they lived happily ever after.


Snow White lived with the dwarves.
and they lived happily until the next merge conflict.


and they lived happily until the next merge conflict (or they made their own branch).

Disclaimer:Evil enchantments were used to create this repository.

And an awesome line was added by an awesome contributor, who lived very happy and finished his PhD on time and without stress.
