## FAQ

### What are the goals and non-goals of this exercise?

 * GitHub Project page
 * Branches
 * Correct C++ programming

Non-goals:

 * In-depth C++ programming

### Why is there only one C++ file?

Because this is easiest for beginners to get compiled and running.

There will be more merge conflicts though ...

### Why don't we use [a testing framework]?

Because this projects requires as little as possible, 
to allow all beginners to get going easily.
