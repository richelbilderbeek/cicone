## FAQ

### What are the goals and non-goals of this exercise?

 * GitHub Project page
 * Branches
 * Correct C++ programming

Non-goals:

 * In-depth C++ programming

### Why is there only one C++ file?

Because this is easiest for beginners to get compiled and running.

There will be more merge conflicts though ...

### Why don't we use [a testing framework]?

Because this projects requires as little as possible, 
to allow all beginners to get going easily.

## Summary of Snow White

This story is **MOSTLY** about dwarves...

Once upon a time ...
there was an average looking young men named White. He didn't know who his parents were, 
so his surname was Snow. He got bullied a lot for that growing up, which only made him stronger.

His best friend was Anan Turning. They met at the military, bonded over pints of cider (cause the loved
fruits and at the same time they were responsible). 


The witch gave Alan Turing an apple. But he wished for a Linux. Then he died :(

One day, there is a gay prince coming. He immediently didn't really find White attractive, but he really needed som love in his life.

I hate you.
