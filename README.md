## FAQ

### What are the goals and non-goals of this exercise?

 * GitHub Project page
 * Branches
 * Correct C++ programming

Non-goals:

 * In-depth C++ programming

### Why is there only one C++ file?

Because this is easiest for beginners to get compiled and running.

There will be more merge conflicts though ...

### Why don't we use [a testing framework]?

Because this projects requires as little as possible, 
to allow all beginners to get going easily.

## Summary of Snow White

Once upon a time ...
there was an average looking young men named White. He didn't know who his parents were, 
so his surname was Snow. He got bullied a lot for that growing up, which only made him stronger.


The witch gave Alan Turing an apple. But he wished for a Linux.

There lived a beautiful girl with her dad and jealous step-mother

the witch gave a red apple to Snow White. Actually there was a full basket of fruit.

Snow White fell asleep for a thousand years

This story involves some dwarves.

Snow White lived with the dwarves.
and they lived happily until the next merge conflict.
